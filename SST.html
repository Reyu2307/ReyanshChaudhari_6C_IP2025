        <h1>India called as Bharat</h1>

       <p>India is a country in South Asia known for its geographical diversity, rich cultural
       heritage, and historical significance. It is often called a land of unity in diversity due to its
       varied landscapes, languages, traditions, and beliefs that coexist harmoniously across the
       country.
       <strong>In ancient times, </strong>India was referred to by different names, including Bharat and
       Jambudvipa. The name Bharat is derived from the ancient king Bharata, and Jambudvipa
       was used in ancient texts to describe the Indian subcontinent.</p> 
    
       <h3>Natural Boundaries of the Indian Subcontinent</h3>
       <ul>
           <li><strong>North:</strong> The towering Himalayan mountain range forms a natural barrier, protecting the northern boundary.</li>
           <li><strong>South:</strong> The Indian Ocean surrounds the southern tip of the subcontinent.</li>
           <li><strong>West:</strong> The Thar Desert and the Arabian Sea serve as natural boundaries to the west.</li>
           <li><strong>East:</strong> The Bay of Bengal and dense forests of the northeastern region form the eastern boundary.</li>
       </ul>
       <h3>Regions Recognizable from the Map</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Kalinga:</strong> Known for the famous Kalinga War fought by Emperor Ashoka.</li>
    <li><strong>Magadha:</strong> A well-known ancient region, home to powerful dynasties and the Mauryan Empire.</li>
    <li><strong>Kosala:</strong> A historical kingdom, linked with the epic Ramayana.</li>
    <li><strong>Vanga:</strong> A region that corresponds to modern Bengal.</li>
    <li><strong>Dakshina Kosala:</strong> Another region linked to southern India’s cultural history.</li>
    <li><strong>Saurashtra:</strong> Known today as part of Gujarat.</li>
    <li><strong>Anga:</strong> One of the ancient kingdoms mentioned in the Mahabharata.</li>
    <li><strong>Surashtra:</strong> Another familiar region, correlating to parts of present-day Gujarat.</li>
</ul>

      <h3>'Snowy Mountains'brief description of Bhārata</h3>
       <p> ‘snowy mountains’ mentioned refer to the Himalayas, which are located in the
       northern part of India. These mountains are known for their snow-covered peaks and serve as
       a natural boundary for the subcontinent.
       The brief description of Bhārata seems correct as it highlights the geographical diversity of
       India, including the snowy Himalayas, vast plains, deserts, and surrounding seas. This
       reflects the rich and varied landscapes that shape the country’s identity.</p>
