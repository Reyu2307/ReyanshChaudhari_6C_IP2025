    <h2>Indian Artistry: Distinct Types of Paintings In India</h2>
    <p>
        The rich cultural diversity of Indian art is well reflected in the vivid, 
        distinct and enchanting folk art and crafts. Various painting styles are prevalent 
        across various regions, each representing tradition, customs, and ideologies passed on 
        from one generation to another. Traditionally, most of the Indian painting styles existed 
        as wall paintings or murals. In due course of time, urbanisation brought these painting forms 
        on paper, canvas, and cloth, etc. Indian painting styles are not just a reflection of the 
        indigenous lifestyle but a perfect example of artistic expression through simple yet distinct compositions.
    </p>
    <h3>Here are some of the popular Indian folk painting styles –</h3>

                    <strong>Madhubani Paintings</strong><br>
                    Madhubani Painting Indian Art<br>
                    Untitled by Baua Devi<br>
                    One of the most celebrated styles of Indian art is Madhubani, which originated in the Mithila region of Bihar 
                    as a form of wall art. This spectacular folk art style was unknown to the outside world until discovered by 
                    the British colonial William G. Archer in 1934 while inspecting the damage after the massive Bihar earthquake. 
                    Archer was amazed by the beautiful illustrations on the exposed interior walls of the houses. The beauty of Madhubani
                    lies in its simple and evocative portrayal of culture and traditions.
                    <br><br>
                    The designs are characterised by eye-catching geometrical patterns, symbolic images, and scenes from mythology. 
                    The balance between the vibrancy of colors and simplicity in its patterns makes Madhubani different from 
                    other painting styles. Bharni, Katchni, Tantrik, Godna, and Kohbar are the five distinct styles of Madhubani painting.

                    <strong>Warli Paintings</strong><br>
                    Warli Painting Indian Art<br>
                    Warli Art<br>
                    This ancient Indian art is a 2500-year-old tradition. Warli paintings of the Thane and Nasik areas of Maharashtra
                    are closely linked with nature and social rituals of the tribe. Warli paintings showcase daily activities of the
                    local people of that community like farming, dancing, hunting, praying, etc.
                    <br><br>
                    Traditionally, women used twigs to draw lively designs with rice paste on mud walls 
                    of tribal houses to mark celebrations of harvests or weddings. Simple geometrical 
                    patterns in white against a red or yellow surface are used to depict everyday life scenes. 
                    Warli art with its linear and monochromatic hues resembles 
                    the execution of pre-historic cave paintings.

                Kalighat Painting Indian Art<br/>
                Kalighat Painting<br/>
                The Kalighat painting style was developed around Mid-19th century in the neighbourhood of Kali Temple in Calcutta. 
                These drawings on paper were done by a group known as “patuas” hence the name Kalighata Pata. 
                They depicted scenes of everyday life and mythological deities in a simple yet captivating manner 
                and developed into the popular kalighat style of painting. Kalighat painters predominantly use earthy 
                Indian colours like indigo, ochre, Indian red, grey, blue and white. The swift, seamless, 
                free-flowing outline is a distinguished characteristic of Kalighat style of paintings.
                 This painting style has inspired many artists, the most famous being Jamini Roy, one of the celebrated artist in Indian art.</li></ul></div>

                Phad Painting Indian Art<br/>
                Pabuji Ki Phad by Bhavana Saxena<br/>
                Phad is the narrative scroll painting tradition from Rajasthan, dating back to a thousand years. 
                Stories of local deities and heroes are painted on horizontal cloth scrolls in hues of red, yellow and orange 
                The Phad scrolls show depictions of battlefields, adventure stories, legendary romances and the richness of the
                 Indian princely states. The Phad painting style leaves one spellbound at how the folk artists accommodate
                 multiple stories in a single composition, yet maintain the aesthetics of artistic expression.</li></ul></div>

                Kalamkari Painting<br/>
                This 3000-year-old organic art of hand and block printing was traditionally used for making narrative scrolls and panels. 
                This exquisite folk art has a strong connect with Persian motifs. Kalamkari derives its name from kalam 
                or pen and is a legacy that has been handed down from generation to generation in Andhra Pradesh. 
                The stylised animal forms, floral motifs and mehrab designs predominant in Kalamkari paintings have 
                also found a place in Kalamkari textiles. Kalamkari art primarily involves earthy colours like indigo, 
                green, rust, black and mustard. </li></ul></div>

                Miniature Painting Indian Art<br/>
                Miniature<br/>
                The Miniature painting style came to India with the Mughals in the 16th century and is identified as an
                 important milestone in the history of Indian art. It developed into a distinct style with a combination of Islamic, 
                Persian and Indian elements. The painting is done using natural stone colors on a paper-based “wasli”. 
                Mineral colors, precious stones, conch shells, gold and silver are used in the miniatures.
                 Fine brushwork, intricacy, detailing and stylization are the unique attributes of miniature painting.
                 Across India, the miniature painting style has developed into distinct schools of miniature paintings 
                like Kangra, Rajasthan, Malwa, Pahadi, Mughal, Deccan etc. to name a few. </li></ul></div>

                Gond Painting Indian Art<br/>
                Gond Painting by Manoj Kumar Tekam<br/>
                These vibrant paintings created with a series of intricately arranged dots and dashes were developed by the
                 Gondi tribe of central India. The tribals recreate mythological tales and oral histories to traditional songs,
                 natural surroundings, important events and rituals in with great intricacy, rich detailing, and bright colors. 
                Traditionally, colors were derived from natural resources like cow dung, plant sap, charcoal, coloured soil, mud, 
                flowers, leaves etc. Gond artists now use commercial water-based colors to paint on paper and canvas. In today’s times,
                 Gond art has moved beyond being a tribal art style with nameless artists to having internationally acclaimed 
                artists like Jangarh Singh Shyam, Venkat Shyam, Bhajju Shyam, Durga Bai Vyam to name a few.</li></ul></div>
