Bhārata
 ‘snowy mountains’ mentioned refer to the Himalayas, which are located in the
northern part of India. These mountains are known for their snow-covered peaks and serve as
a natural boundary for the subcontinent.
The brief description of Bhārata seems correct as it highlights the geographical diversity of
India, including the snowy Himalayas, vast plains, deserts, and surrounding seas. This
reflects the rich and varied landscapes that shape the country’s identity.

symbolize the unity and harmony among the various cultures, regions, and people of the
land, fostering the idea of friendship and collaboration.

significant symbol in ancient Indian culture and spirituality. The name would represent a
land that is enlightened, prosperous, and full of vitality, much like the sun’s life-giving force.

and textiles. Merchants and traders travelled to acquire these goods and establish trade
relations.

Nalanda and Takshashila, which attracted scholars from around the world seeking
knowledge in subjects like philosophy, astronomy, medicine, and mathematics.

explore its rich spiritual traditions, as India was the birthplace of religions like
Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism.

of cash and commodity transactions in seventeenthcentury
India.

1740s
